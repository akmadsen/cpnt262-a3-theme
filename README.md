# CPNT 262 - Wordpress - Assignment 3 

## Sechelt Theme

Based off of the naked-wordpress theme. Credits left intact at the bottom of this document. 

With thanks to [@andjosh][0] and their team. 

### Sources of Inspiration 

The original [Sechelt Visitor Centre][9] website is non-responsive, with a static image 
as a background, an an overall dated look and feel. 

The primary source of inspiration was the [Visit Prince George website][5]. The site has 
an integrated visual identity, heavy use of graphical assets, and a very modern look 
and feel. 

A secondary source of inspiration was found through the [Penticton Tourism Site][8], which
was very similar in design with the Prince George site. Penticton's page, however, is more
subtle with their font choices, colour palette and aesthetic. 

Additional scouted sites were: 
* [Visit Yellowkife][7]
* [Okotoks Tourism][6]

Both the above had wide, vivid hero features, with functional direcroties near the 
bottom of the site.
